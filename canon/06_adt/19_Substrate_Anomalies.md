**19 — Substrate Anomalies

Signals That the System Is Deviating from Canon Truth**

Overview

Substrate Anomalies are deviations from expected authenticated behavior.
They are early-warning signals that something is wrong —
whether caused by malicious intent, system error, data inconsistency, or unauthorized action.

Anomalies do not always mean an attack,
but all anomalies require investigation, enforcement, or correction.

They are the triggers that keep the Sovereign Substrate sovereign.

19.1 Characteristics of Anomalies

A condition is considered anomalous when it:

Violates a Substrate Invariant

Breaks a canonical sequence or flow

Produces nondeterministic outcomes

Introduces conflicting truth states

Creates unauthorized access or exposure

Fails identity or vault validation

Bypasses enforcement logic

Disrupts event ordering in CSR

Ignores policy constraints

Attempts external integration without L8

Any one of these symptoms is enough to classify an event as anomalous.

19.2 Categories of Anomalies
A. Identity Anomalies

Unexpected identity change

Credential mismatch

Stale or invalid session

Impossible user behavior pattern

KYC mismatch or corruption

B. Vault/Data Anomalies

Hash mismatch

Unauthorized write attempt

Access outside policy boundaries

Conflicting data versions

Drift between vault state and CSR

C. MAIAi Anomalies

Ambiguous or contradictory interpretations

Missing context for grounded reasoning

Unexpected risk classification

Requests that cannot be canonically evaluated

D. Architect Anomalies

Attempted sequence bypass

Invalid or missing enforcement boundaries

Policy conflicts

Orchestration logic contradiction

E. Execution (BAINCA) Anomalies

Non-deterministic output

Execution packet mismatch

Runtime environment deviation

Unauthorized workload execution

F. ADT Anomalies

Looping or runaway autonomy

Outdated state used in decision-making

Broken continuity

Conflicting lifecycle events

G. CSR Anomalies

Fork attempts

Timestamp inconsistencies

Unanchored event insertion

Event duplication

Non-linear sequence ordering

H. Interlinking Anomalies

External requests missing validation

Input format mismatch

Attempted data exfiltration

Unauthorized integration endpoints

19.3 Anomaly Detection

Anomalies may be detected by:

MAIAi (contextual inconsistency)

Architect (policy violation)

ADT (continuity break)

BAINCA (execution mismatch)

CSR (ordering conflict)

L8 (external invalidation)

Detection always precedes correction.

19.4 Anomaly Severity Levels
1. Informational — harmless irregularity
2. Low — harmless but unexpected
3. Medium — may indicate drift
4. High — requires immediate enforcement
5. Critical — potential collapse or attack
6. Catastrophic — threatens sovereignty or Canon itself

Severity classification determines the enforcement path.

19.5 Enforcement Trigger Conditions

Anomalies trigger enforcement when:

Identity cannot be confirmed

Vault state is inconsistent

Execution deviates from canonical packet

MAIAi cannot ground intent

CSR ordering breaks

An external system bypasses L8

ADT autonomy conflicts with policy

Any invariant is violated

19.6 Failure Modes Prevented

Undetected corruption

Silent infiltration

Temporal inconsistencies

Rogue autonomy

Shadow execution

Cross-layer drift

Hidden exploitation

Forking logic

19.7 Summary

Substrate Anomalies are the system’s early detection mechanism.
They expose inconsistencies before they can become violations —
and violations before they can become collapse events.

They ensure the Sovereign Substrate stays aligned with authenticated, immutable truth.

**44 — Substrate Restoration Rules

How the Substrate Returns to a Valid, Sovereign, and Canon-Aligned State**

Overview

Restoration Rules define how the Sovereign Substrate repairs itself after:

termination

violations

contradictions

context failure

continuity breaks

nondeterministic execution

vault conflicts

identity inconsistencies

CSR anchoring failures

Restoration is not “undoing.”
It is returning to the last authenticated, sovereign, deterministic truth — then re-evaluating forward safely.

Restoration ensures the system is self-healing.

44.1 The Three Restoration Modes

The substrate uses exactly three restoration modes:

1. Canonical Restoration

Returning to the last valid Canon event.

This is the gold standard.

2. Context Restoration

Recovering missing or corrupted identity, vault, or policy context.

This allows operations to continue without rewriting history.

3. Continuity Restoration

Re-establishing ADT alignment, sequence, or governance scope.

Autonomy is reattached to true state.

These modes may be applied separately or together depending on the failure.

44.2 Restoration Triggers

Restoration activates when:

identity changes mid-operation

vault integrity breaks

MAIAi cannot retrieve complete context

policy conflicts persist

execution produces drift

ADT continuity breaks

CSR cannot anchor cleanly

L8 authentication fails

termination occurs

44.3 Universal Restoration Sequence

Restoration always follows this order:

Step 1 — Freeze the unsafe operation

Stop immediately.

Step 2 — Identify the broken state

Identity → Vault → Context → Policy → Execution → ADT → CSR → L8.

Step 3 — Re-establish the last canonical truth

Canon truth becomes the baseline.

Step 4 — Restore missing or inconsistent dependencies

Identity, Vault, Context, Policy, etc.

Step 5 — Validate deterministic execution for re-entry

No drift allowed.

Step 6 — Reconnect autonomy through continuity checks

ADT cannot continue until aligned.

Step 7 — Anchor the restoration event in CSR

History includes the repair.

Step 8 — Resume safely or terminate if still unsafe

Forward motion only if all criteria hold.

44.4 Layer-Level Restoration Rules
Identity Layer

Restore identity provenance; resolve revocation or mismatch.

Vault Layer

Force retrieval of the last authenticated version; discard conflicts.

MAIAi Layer

Rebuild context; flush hallucination-prone inference paths.

Architect Layer

Re-evaluate policies using restored context.

Execution (BAINCA)

Re-run compute deterministically using restored state.

ADT Layer

Reconnect lifecycle to the restored Canon state.

CSR Layer

Record the restoration and re-seal continuity.

L8 Layer

Revalidate external pathways before re-engagement.

44.5 Restoration Constraints

Restoration may not:

rewrite Canon

infer missing truth

fabricate context

alter identity

allow nondeterministic output

skip governance

resume autonomy without checks

re-anchor conflicting events

Restoration always reinforces sovereignty.

44.6 Restoration Failures (Escalation Conditions)

If restoration is not possible, the substrate escalates to:

containment

quarantine

sovereign protection mode (Tier 5)

Restoration failure indicates deeper structural inconsistency.

44.7 Guarantees Provided by Restoration

Restoration ensures that:

errors never compound

drift never becomes future truth

autonomy never resumes unsafely

execution never re-enters without determinism

history never fractures

sovereignty is never compromised

Restoration is the substrate’s self-healing system.

44.8 Summary

Substrate Restoration Rules define exactly how the system returns to safe, sovereign, canonical truth after any form of disruption.

Restoration is:

deterministic

invariant-aligned

Canon-anchored

non-destructive

mandatory

self-healing

If termination stops the unsafe path,
restoration creates the safe path back.

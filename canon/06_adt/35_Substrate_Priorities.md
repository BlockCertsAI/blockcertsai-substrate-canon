**35 — Substrate Priorities

The Ordered Hierarchy That Governs All Substrate Decisions**

Overview

Substrate Priorities define the hierarchy of importance the Sovereign Substrate uses to make decisions at every layer — from evaluating intent to executing workloads, applying policies, restoring truth, or defending against threats.

Priorities ensure that the system always chooses the safest, most sovereign, most deterministic option when multiple paths are available.

They prevent ambiguity, conflict, and nondeterministic behavior by giving every layer a clear order of what matters most.

35.1 Why Priorities Matter

Priorities allow the substrate to:

Resolve conflicts deterministically

Prevent contradictory decisions

Maintain sovereignty under pressure

Guide MAIAi reasoning

Constrain Architect governance

Steer execution and autonomy

Shape recovery actions

Keep the Canon consistent

Without priorities, different layers could disagree — leading to drift, instability, or collapse.

35.2 Global Priority Hierarchy

The Sovereign Substrate follows this universal order:

Priority 1 — Substrate Invariants

Unbreakable system truths.
These override everything.

Priority 2 — Canonical Truth (CSR)

The history of what actually happened.
No decision may contradict the Canon.

Priority 3 — Identity Sovereignty

Actions must align with verified, authenticated identity.

Priority 4 — Vault Integrity

Data must reflect authenticated, uncorrupted sovereign state.

Priority 5 — Policy Governance

Policies shape what is allowed and must be applied without contradiction.

Priority 6 — Deterministic Execution

Compute must behave predictably within approved boundaries.

Priority 7 — Autonomy Continuity (ADT)

Autonomous processes must align with identity and Canon.

Priority 8 — External Interlinking

External interactions come last — always subordinate to internal truth.

35.3 Layer-Specific Priority Interpretations

Each layer maps the global hierarchy into concrete decisions.

Identity Layer (L1)

Priorities ensure identity cannot be overridden by execution or autonomy.

Vault Layer (L2)

Vault integrity overrides convenience or external requests.

MAIAi (L3)

Reasoning must follow invariants → Canon → identity → vault → policy.

This keeps intelligence authentically grounded.

Architect (L4)

When policies conflict:

Identity wins over convenience

Canon wins over autonomy

Invariants win over everything

Execution (BAINCA) (L5)

Determinism always outweighs speed or performance.

ADT (L6)

Autonomy must yield to identity, vault state, policies, and Canon.

No agent can outrank the substrate.

CSR (L7)

History must maintain ordering even if it slows down execution.

L8 (Interlinking)

External systems never outrank substrate truth, identity, or safety.

35.4 Priority-Based Conflict Resolution

When layers disagree, the substrate resolves by priority:

Example:

MAIAi wants to infer context (Priority 6)

Vault state is incomplete (Priority 4)

Resolution: Inference denied. Vault integrity wins.

Another example:

ADT wants to continue a workflow (Priority 7)

Identity state changed (Priority 3)

Resolution: ADT frozen. Identity sovereignty wins.

35.5 Failure Modes Prevented by Priorities

Policy conflicts

Governance deadlocks

Rogue autonomy

Hallucination or ungrounded reasoning

External system influence

Timeline contradictions

Execution drift

Unsafe recovery actions

35.6 Priority-Driven Escalation

As risk increases:

Lower priorities are restricted

Higher priorities dominate decisions

External interactions fall away first

Internal invariants dominate last

This ensures survival-first decision-making.

35.7 Summary

Substrate Priorities define the moral and operational compass of the authenticated internet.

They ensure that:

Identity stays sovereign

Vaults stay correct

MAIAi stays grounded

Architect stays consistent

Execution stays deterministic

ADT stays governed

CSR stays truthful

External systems stay subordinate

All decisions — big or small — are guided by this hierarchy.

When priorities conflict, sovereignty wins.

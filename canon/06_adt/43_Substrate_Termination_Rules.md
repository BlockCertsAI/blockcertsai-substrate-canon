**43 — Substrate Termination Rules

When and How Operations Must Halt to Preserve Safety and Sovereignty**

Overview

Termination Rules specify when an operation must stop — immediately, safely, and without ambiguity — because proceeding would violate invariants, break safety guarantees, or compromise canonical truth.

Termination protects the substrate from:

unsafe continuation

ambiguous or inconsistent state transitions

nondeterministic execution

identity or context loss

autonomy misalignment

external influence

unresolved contradictions

Termination is not error.
Termination is preventative sovereignty enforcement.

43.1 Global Termination Conditions

An operation must terminate when:

1. Identity becomes uncertain or changes mid-operation.

Identity discontinuity = immediate stop.

2. Vault state becomes unavailable, stale, or contradictory.

No context without truth.

3. MAIAi cannot reason without hallucination risk.

No context → no reasoning.

4. Governance cannot produce a single valid outcome.

Contradictory policy = halt.

5. Execution produces nondeterministic output.

Drift = invalid output → terminate.

6. ADT continuity breaks or autonomy contradicts governance.

No forward motion allowed.

7. CSR cannot anchor safely.

No anchoring → no progression.

8. External systems cannot be verified.

L8 authentication failure = terminate.

If any one of these occurs, the operation must stop instantly.

43.2 Termination vs. Completion

Termination is not:

a successful end

a completed workflow

a canonical event

Termination is:

a safe stop

a protective halt

a refusal to proceed

a preservation of invariants and truth

Terminated operations must be corrected, repeated, or abandoned.

43.3 Types of Termination
A. Hard Termination

Triggered by catastrophic violation or existential risk.

Examples:

identity mismatch

vault corruption

nondeterministic compute

Canon anchoring failure

Action:
Immediate halt, escalate to highest tier.

B. Soft Termination

Triggered by correctable or temporary issues.

Examples:

context missing

policy conflict

external verification delay

Action:
Pause → correct → resume only if safe.

C. Preventative Termination

Triggered before a violation occurs.

Examples:

autonomy trending toward unbounded behavior

potential identity-role conflict

external system anomaly

Action:
Stop early → prevent drift.

43.4 Layer-Level Termination Rules
Identity Layer

Terminate if identity cannot be proven or changes unexpectedly.

Vault Layer

Terminate if vault data is stale, missing, or inconsistent.

MAIAi Layer

Terminate reasoning if required context is missing or unsafe.

Architect Layer

Terminate governance if resolutions conflict or escalate improperly.

execution (BAINCA)

Terminate if enclave output is nondeterministic or unsafe.

ADT Layer

Terminate autonomy if continuity is broken or contradicts policy.

CSR Layer

Terminate anchoring if ordering cannot be guaranteed.

L8 Layer

Terminate external connections when authentication fails.

43.5 Termination Pathway

When termination occurs, the substrate follows this universal path:

Immediate Halt

Containment or Isolation (if needed)

Classification of Termination Type

Protection Application

Correction Attempt

Reinstatement Check

CSR Anchoring of the Termination Event

Safe Resume or Abandon

Termination is structured and repeatable.

43.6 Termination Guarantees

Termination ensures that:

unsafe operations never reach Canon

drift never becomes history

contradictions never become truth

autonomy never exceeds authority

external systems never override safety

nondeterministic compute never impacts state

Termination is the substrate’s emergency brake.

43.7 Summary

Substrate Termination Rules define when and how the system must stop to remain sovereign, safe, and consistent.

Termination is:

protective

deterministic

invariant-aligned

canonical

non-optional

If an operation becomes unsafe, uncertain, or unverifiable,
termination is the only allowed outcome.

**08 — Interlinking Layer (L8)

Authenticated Gateways & External System Integration**

Overview

The Interlinking Layer (L8) is the controlled boundary between the Sovereign Substrate and all external systems.
It governs how authenticated data, workflows, and processes interact with the outside world — without sacrificing sovereignty or compliance.

L8 is the only allowed interface for external communication.
It enforces strict policy, identity anchoring, and Canon coherence across every outbound or inbound interaction.

8.1 Core Responsibilities
• Authenticated External Access

All external requests must originate from a verified actor and be validated end-to-end across the Canon layers.

• Controlled Data Egress

No data may leave the substrate unless explicitly permitted and policy-bound.

• Verified Ingress

Incoming data or instructions must pass identity, integrity, and policy verification.

• Regulated Interoperability

L8 provides safe bridges to legacy systems, APIs, clouds, blockchains, and external agents.

• Enforcement at the Boundary

The Architect and MAIAi use L8 to approve, deny, or transform interactions at the edge.

8.2 Relationship to Other Layers
CSR → L8

All outbound interactions reference Canon truth.

L6 ADT → L8

ADTs may initiate external actions, but only through authenticated gateways.

External Systems → L8 → L1-L7

Inbound requests must pass through L8 before entering any substrate layer.

8.3 Guarantees Provided by the Interlinking Layer
• No unauthorized data transfer

Nothing enters or exits without identity and policy checks.

• No unverified integrations

All integrations must be authenticated and audited.

• No bypass paths

There are no hidden channels around L8 — it is the sole entry and exit point.

• No cross-system drift

External systems cannot corrupt, overwrite, or conflict with Canon state.

• No exfiltration

Data cannot leak through weak APIs, misconfigured gateways, or shadow integrations.

8.4 Examples of L8 Interactions

API calls to or from legacy apps

Cross-chain verified messages

Regulated data exchange with enterprise systems

Cloud migration or hybrid deployments

Audited reporting to regulators

Hardware integration (IoT, edge devices)

AI model interfacing with external environments

8.5 Failure Modes Prevented

API exploits

Man-in-the-middle attacks

Unverified ingestion

Data exfiltration

Protocol downgrade attacks

Unauthorized cross-system triggering

External system drift affecting Canon state

8.6 Summary

The Interlinking Layer is the substrate’s safety boundary.
It ensures that anything leaving or entering the Sovereign Substrate maintains identity, integrity, and Canon alignment.

Nothing bypasses L8.
Nothing escapes without permission.
Nothing enters without verification.

This is how sovereignty extends into the external world.

**06 — Agentic Digital Twin (L6)

Authenticated Autonomy & Continuity Engine**

Overview

The Agentic Digital Twin (ADT) is the continuity layer of the Sovereign Substrate.
It mirrors authenticated state — identity, vaults, processes, workloads, and system behavior — and maintains an always-current model of what the substrate is doing and what it is allowed to do.

Where MAIAi provides intelligence and the Architect enforces policy,
the ADT maintains continuity, memory, lifecycle, and long-running processes.

It is the authenticated agent that acts on behalf of users, enterprises, and systems — always grounded in Canon truth.

6.1 Core Responsibilities
• State Continuity

Maintains a real-time, authenticated representation of actors, processes, workloads, and execution context.

• Agentic Autonomy

Executes permitted actions on behalf of an actor or system without repeated human initiation.

• Lifecycle Management

Tracks the full lifecycle of processes: initiation, execution, monitoring, escalation, completion, or rollback.

• Canon-Coherent Behavior

Every autonomous action must align with identity, vaults, MAIAi evaluation, and Architect validation.

• Long-Running Processes

Handles timers, schedules, workflows, monitoring loops, and cross-system coordination.

6.2 Relationship to Other Layers
L3 → L6

MAIAi provides intent signals and contextual decisions.
ADT turns these into persistent, autonomous behavior.

L4 → L6

The Architect enforces rules; the ADT carries out ongoing, approved processes under those rules.

L5 → L6

BAINCA supplies execution results; ADT updates continuity state and initiates next steps.

L6 → L8

ADT can interface with external systems through authenticated gateways, always bound by Canon policy.

6.3 Guarantees Provided by the ADT
• No unbounded autonomy

All actions require authenticated grounding and validated permissions.

• No hallucinated state

ADT cannot maintain or act on imagined or synthetic data; all state flows from vaults and validated execution logs.

• No drift

Continuity state must match the Canon; any divergence triggers enforcement from the Architect.

• No external override

ADT cannot be hijacked or steered through prompts, exploits, or hidden channels.

• Persistent but governed autonomy

The ADT can operate indefinitely but only within authenticated, policy-bound constraints.

6.4 Example ADT Flow (Simplified)

Actor performs initial action

Identity verifies

Vault supplies state

MAIAi interprets intent

Architect authorizes and validates

ADT assumes autonomous responsibility

BAINCA executes workloads

ADT updates continuity state

Canon records authenticated events

6.5 Failure Modes Prevented

Orphaned processes

Unbounded or rogue autonomy

State desynchronization

Permit creep or privilege leakage

External manipulation of long-running tasks

Hidden execution paths

Autonomy without oversight

6.6 Summary

The Agentic Digital Twin gives the Substrate its governed autonomy.
It is the persistent, authenticated agent that maintains continuity, executes permitted long-running behaviors, coordinates workflows, and ensures the system operates as a coherent whole.

The ADT is the operational backbone of authenticated automation —
autonomous, but never unchecked.
Continuous, but never unverified.

**45 — Substrate Reconciliation Rules

How Divergent Signals Are Merged into One Authoritative Truth**

Overview

Reconciliation Rules define the methods by which the Sovereign Substrate harmonizes:

partial truths

divergent states

conflicting signals

layered inconsistencies

differences between expected and observed reality

Reconciliation is not correction (fixing a violation) and not restoration (returning to the last valid state).
Reconciliation is the process of aligning multiple legitimate but incomplete inputs into a single, consistent truth.

It ensures the substrate can move forward with clarity even when multiple layers contribute independent signals.

45.1 When Reconciliation Is Required

Reconciliation triggers when the substrate detects:

valid but incomplete identity signals

vault fields updated at different times

MAIAi receiving multiple relevant context blocks

a policy stack where more than one rule applies

execution outputs within tolerance but not identical

ADT receiving parallel continuity indicators

CSR preparing to anchor compound events

external systems providing compatible but differing metadata

Reconciliation occurs only when all signals are internally valid, but not yet aligned.

45.2 The Three Reconciliation Methods
1. Canonical Reconciliation

If divergent signals reference different points in time,
→ choose the one aligned with the Canon’s ordering.

Time is the ultimate discriminator.

2. Priority Reconciliation

If signals have different trust or authority levels,
→ apply the Substrate Priority Hierarchy.

Identity > Vault > Context > Policy > Execution > Autonomy > External

3. Deterministic Reconciliation

If signals are non-conflicting but produce different valid paths,
→ choose the path guaranteed to produce deterministic results.

Safety + Determinism > Optional Flexibility

45.3 Layer-Level Reconciliation Rules
Identity Layer

Merge multiple identity signals by:

provenance

last verified update

non-revoked status

Identity cannot fork — reconciliation selects the sole valid lineage.

Vault Layer

Combine vault fields using:

the latest authenticated version

Canon alignment

permission constraints

conflict resolution via deterministic hashing

Vault reconciliation always outputs one precise state.

MAIAi Layer

Resolve multiple context sources by:

eliminating duplicates

selecting the non-stale data

prioritizing identity-owned context

rejecting any probabilistic or inferred truth

MAIAi reconciles only what is authenticated.

Architect Layer

Resolve overlapping policies by:

applying most restrictive policy

enforcing invariant-aligned rule

rejecting conflicting policies

escalating irreconcilable contradictions

Governance always outputs a single allowed path.

Execution Layer (BAINCA)

For computations producing slightly different deterministic outputs (rare but possible):

re-run with canonical inputs

force single deterministic output

reject any path that deviates

Only one execution result can become truth.

ADT Layer

Align continuity markers through:

canonical ordering

state equivalence checks

governance constraints

Autonomy resumes from the reconciled continuity point.

CSR Layer

Reconcile compound events by:

ordering

grouping

anchoring rules

timestamp precedence

Canon remains strictly linear.

L8 Layer

Reconcile metadata from verified external systems by:

applying least privilege

selecting the authenticated superset

discarding unverifiable subsets

External truth is always subordinate.

45.4 Conflict vs. Divergence

Reconciliation applies only to divergence, not contradiction.

Divergence = multiple valid inputs that need alignment

Contradiction = violation that triggers Correction or Termination

The substrate never reconciles contradictions.

45.5 Reconciliation Failure

Reconciliation fails when:

signals contradict

Canon cannot disambiguate

determinism cannot be preserved

identity or vault state becomes invalid

any resolution would violate invariants

FAILED RECONCILIATION → correction, restoration, or termination.

45.6 Guarantees Provided by Reconciliation

Reconciliation ensures:

multiple legitimate signals always collapse into one truth

no forks or ambiguous states

no partial truth leakage

no multi-path autonomy

no conflicting context

no governance ambiguity

no external override of internal truth

Reconciliation is how the substrate “thinks in unison.”

45.7 Summary

Substrate Reconciliation Rules define how the system merges valid but divergent signals into one consistent, sovereign, canonical truth.

Reconciliation:

aligns

harmonizes

clarifies

unifies

strengthens

The outcome is always one state, one truth, one path forward.

**13 — Substrate Flows

How Authenticated Actions Move Through the Canon**

Overview

Substrate Flows describe the required path every authenticated action must follow across the Sovereign Substrate.
These flows guarantee that identity, data, intelligence, policy, execution, autonomy, and truth remain synchronized and verifiable.

Every valid operation follows a canonical flow.
Anything outside these flows is rejected.

13.1 The Core Execution Flow

This is the fundamental path for all authenticated actions:

Identity (L1) — Verify the actor

Vault (L2) — Retrieve authenticated data

MAIAi (L3) — Interpret intent + validate context

Architect (L4) — Enforce policy + approve or deny

BAINCA (L5) — Execute the approved workload

ADT (L6) — Maintain continuity + lifecycle

CSR (L7) — Record the immutable event

Interlinking (L8) — Optional external interaction

This is the “golden path” that all substrate behavior must follow.

13.2 ADT Continuity Flow

Used for long-running or autonomous processes:

ADT monitors state changes

New event or condition occurs

Identity + Vault reconfirmation

MAIAi evaluates new conditions

Architect authorizes next step

BAINCA executes

CSR anchors each transition

ADT updates continuity model

This ensures autonomous processes never drift or execute outside bounds.

13.3 External Interaction Flow (L8)

All inbound or outbound interactions must follow the same structure:

External system sends/receives request

Interlinking Layer authenticates identity + validates format

Vaults confirm referenced data

MAIAi evaluates meaning + intent

Architect enforces policy

BAINCA executes

CSR records event

No integration bypasses this flow.

13.4 Error & Drift Correction Flow

Triggered whenever invariants are violated:

Detection of mismatch (by Architect, ADT, or CSR)

Substrate halts unauthorized execution

Identify last valid Canon event

Restore state to last authenticated truth

Log incident in CSR

Resume operations within canonical flow

This is how the system self-heals.

13.5 Enforcement Flow

Used when violations require correction:

Identity confirmed

Vault and CSR compared

MAIAi classifies violation

Architect determines enforcement action

ADT or BAINCA executes corrective process

CSR records outcome

This ensures predictable, consistent enforcement.

13.6 Failure Modes Prevented

Bypass execution

Partial or ambiguous state transitions

Unverified autonomy

Cross-layer drift

Forks or collapse events

Cloud override

Shadow integration paths

Timeline inconsistencies

13.7 Summary

Substrate Flows define exactly how actions must move through the Sovereign Substrate.
They prevent chaos, ambiguity, and drift by ensuring that every event follows the same authenticated, deterministic pathway.

Anything outside these flows is, by definition, a threat — and is rejected or corrected.

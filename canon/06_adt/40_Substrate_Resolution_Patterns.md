**40 — Substrate Resolution Patterns

Deterministic Methods for Resolving Conflict, Ambiguity, and Inconsistency**

Overview

Resolution Patterns define how the Sovereign Substrate resolves any form of conflict across identity, data, context, policy, execution, autonomy, history, or external interaction.

The substrate never guesses.
Never randomly chooses.
Never leaves ambiguity unresolved.

Resolution Patterns ensure one truth, one path, and one consistent outcome under all conditions.

40.1 The Four Universal Resolution Patterns

The substrate uses exactly four methods of resolution:

1. Priority Resolution

Conflicts resolve according to the Substrate Priority Hierarchy.

Example:
Identity > Vault > Policy > Execution.

Identity always wins over everything but invariants.

2. Canonical Resolution

If a conflict involves truth, history, or ordering, the Canon determines the answer.

The Canon is the supreme arbiter of “what really happened.”

3. Deterministic Resolution

If a conflict involves execution, output, or reasoning:

the deterministic path is chosen

nondeterministic outcomes are rejected

drift is treated as error

the system restores the last known deterministic state

4. Protective Resolution

If any resolution would compromise safety or sovereignty,
the substrate chooses the safest option — even if it halts or delays the workflow.

Safety > Progress
Sovereignty > Convenience

40.2 Layer-Level Applications
Identity Conflicts

Resolution Pattern: Priority Resolution → Canonical Resolution
Identity provenance always resolves identity ambiguity.

Vault Conflicts

Resolution Pattern: Canonical Resolution → Priority Resolution
The Canon decides which vault version is authoritative.

MAIAi Reasoning Conflicts

Resolution Pattern: Deterministic Resolution → Protective Resolution
MAIAi cannot speculate when context is ambiguous.

Architect Governance Conflicts

Resolution Pattern: Priority Resolution
Policies resolve according to invariants and hierarchy.

Execution Conflicts

Resolution Pattern: Deterministic Resolution
Conflicting results → reject nondeterministic pathway.

ADT Autonomy Conflicts

Resolution Pattern:
Priority Resolution → Deterministic Resolution → Protective Resolution
ADT must submit to identity, Canon, and safety.

CSR (History) Conflicts

Resolution Pattern: Canonical Resolution
History can only have one version.

Interlinking Conflicts

Resolution Pattern: Protective Resolution → Priority Resolution
External systems never outrank substrate safety.

40.3 Timing Conflicts

When two operations compete:

earlier authenticated state wins

later unverified state loses

The substrate rejects future-dependent logic.

40.4 Policy Conflicts

If two policies disagree:

the stricter one applies

the safer one applies

or the invariant-aligned one applies

If still unresolved → escalate.

40.5 Autonomy Conflicts

If the ADT wants to proceed but:

identity changed

vault state changed

a higher priority condition surfaced

→ autonomy freezes.

40.6 Error-Type Resolution

Ambiguity → defer

Contradiction → freeze and correct

Violation → enforce

Uncertainty → safety-first deferral

Inconsistency → restore the last canonical state

40.7 Resolution Patterns Under Stress

In high-risk or high-load conditions:

Priority Resolution becomes stronger

Canonical Resolution becomes stricter

Deterministic Resolution rejects borderline outputs

Protective Resolution overrides everything else

This ensures the substrate tightens, not weakens, under pressure.

40.8 Resolution Failures (Impossible States)

Resolution cannot:

produce two valid answers

contradict Canon

produce nondeterministic results

allow unsafe transitions

weaken sovereignty

If resolution cannot complete safely, the system halts and escalates.

40.9 Summary

Substrate Resolution Patterns define the four deterministic ways the system resolves any conflict:

Priority

Canon

Determinism

Protection

These patterns ensure that every ambiguity ends in one truth, one decision, one safe path forward.

No matter the layer.
No matter the complexity.
No matter the threat.

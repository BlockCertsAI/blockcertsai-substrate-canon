Sovereign Substrate — Master Overview

The Sovereign Substrate is the canonical architecture that defines how BlockCertsAI provides authenticated digital infrastructure.
It replaces identity providers, cloud providers, trust intermediaries, and bridge layers with a unified, verifiable substrate composed of:

Identity (L1)

Vaulted Data (L2 / SVS)

Canonical State (L3 / CSR)

Compute (L4 / BAINCA)

Behavioral Enforcement (L5 / MAIAi)

Governance & Policy (L6 / Architect)

Control Plane (L7 / ADT)

Routing & External Boundaries (L8)

The Sovereign Substrate ensures:

No central authorities, no CEOs, no admin override

Verified identity from genesis

Immutable state with no substitution rules

Executable compute without external dependency

Behavioral enforcement in real time

Programmable governance with self-healing constraints

Intent-based control that cannot execute code

A hard external boundary enforced by routing rules

Every layer produces exactly one class of object, preventing cross-layer impersonation, spoofing, or substitution.

This document serves as the root description for all layer specifications.

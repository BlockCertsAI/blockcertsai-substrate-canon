**03 — MAIAi (L3)

Authenticated Intelligence & Agentic Enforcement**

Overview

MAIAi is the authenticated intelligence layer of the Sovereign Substrate.
It operates only on verified identities, vaulted data, and authenticated events, ensuring every inference, decision, or automation aligns with the Canon.

Role in the Substrate (L3)

MAIAi transforms static identity and vaulted data into active, enforceable intelligence.
It evaluates requests, enforces rules, executes automation, and maintains trust by grounding all actions in authenticated state.

3.1 Core Functions
• Intent Verification

MAIAi evaluates whether a request is valid, permitted, and compliant with Canon policies.

• Contextual Intelligence

MAIAi maintains situational awareness across identity, vaults, processes, and past events to prevent unauthorized execution.

• Autonomous Enforcement

MAIAi triggers enforcement actions when deviation, tampering, or anomaly is detected.

• Deterministic + Probabilistic Blend

Rules are deterministic; intelligence is agentic and adaptive — but only inside authenticated boundaries.

3.2 Relationship to Other Layers
L1 Identity → L3 Intelligence

MAIAi only operates on verified identity, never pseudonymous or untrusted actors.

L2 Vaults → L3 Intelligence

Vaulted data acts as truth; MAIAi derives interpretation, governance, and automation from it.

L3 → L4 Architect

MAIAi provides verified decisions and intent signals to the Architect, which executes enforcement at the orchestration layer.

3.3 Guarantees Provided by MAIAi
• No hallucination

MAIAi cannot fabricate state; it must anchor all reasoning to the Vault or Canon.

• No ungrounded execution

All agentic actions are authenticated, logged, and reversible through Canon restoration.

• No external override

MAIAi cannot be hijacked by prompts, jailbreaks, or external model steering — identity and vaults constrain behavior.

• No model drift

MAIAi maintains alignment via authenticated feedback and Canon policies, not statistical guesswork.

3.4 Example Canon Flow (Simplified)

Identity (L1) → verifies actor
Vaults (L2) → provides trusted data
MAIAi (L3) → interprets, evaluates, authorizes
Architect (L4) → executes or denies
BAINCA / Runtime (L5+) → carries out enforcement or workload

3.5 Failure Modes Prevented

Unauthorized execution

Misaligned agent behavior

Data leakage

Anomaly propagation

Policy violations

Replay or fork attacks

Unbounded autonomy

3.6 Summary

MAIAi gives the Sovereign Substrate its intelligence — but always within authenticated, deterministic boundaries.
It interprets reality, enforces rules, and ensures every action in the system aligns with identity, data integrity, and Canon truth.
